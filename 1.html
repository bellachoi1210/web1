<h2>The giant panda은 누구인가?</h2>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_panda" target="_blank" title="the giant panda specification">The giant panda</a> (Ailuropoda melanoleuca; Chinese: 大熊猫; pinyin: dàxióngmāo),[5] also known as <strong>the panda <u>bear</u> (or simply the panda)</strong>, is a bear[6] native to South Central China.
<p style="margin-top:40px">It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body.

</p>The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid. <p>Though it belongs to the order Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and leaves making up more than 99% of its diet.[7]</p> Giant pandas in the wild will occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along with specially prepared food.
